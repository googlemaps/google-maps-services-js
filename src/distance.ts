     * The starting point for calculating travel distance and time.
     * You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|`), in the form of an address, latitude/longitude coordinates,
     * or a place ID:
     *  - If you pass an address, the service geocodes the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate distance.
     *    This coordinate may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.
     *
     *    `origins=Bobcaygeon+ON|24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON`
     *
     *  - If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, they are used unchanged to calculate distance.
     *    Ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.
     *
     *    `origins=41.43206,-81.38992|-33.86748,151.20699`
     *
     *  - If you supply a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`.
     *    You can only specify a place ID if the request includes an API key or a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID.
     *    You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places SDK (including Place Autocomplete).
     *
     *    `origins=place_id:ChIJ3S-JXmauEmsRUcIaWtf4MzE`
     *
     *  - Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of coordinates using the
     *    [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm).
     *    This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using
     *    an encoded polyline.
     *
     *     - Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `origins=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`
     *     - You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`).
     *       For example: `origins=enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|enc:udymA{~bxM:`

     *    observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language.
     *    Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
     *  - If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.
     *  - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return,
     *    and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
     *    such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.
